\section{Overview}

The Building Healthy Communities programme is a partnership that delivers a range of initiatives, activites, interventions and skills classes to improve the wellbeing of the community as a whole, and the members of that community. You, a volunteer, help to run these initiatives. But if you've come this far, you already know that. What you want to know is, what's this website got to do with anything, and how do I use it? That's where this manual comes in.

The Building Healthy Communities website is a fast, convenient way for you to access details about the initiatives you help to run, times for the next meetings, and ways for you to add new meetings and take attendance. The website also features contact details and a way to request changes to your own details, contact or otherwise. This manual will walk you through the process of logging in, viewing your details and initiatives, and doing all the other things listed above. It will also give additional guides on how to contact staff members, and what to do if you lose your login details.

\section{System Access and Login}
\label{sec:syslogin}

The website is currently hosted at \url{http://hidden-mountain-49766.herokuapp.com} , which can be accessed through most major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE8 or higher). Before accessing the site, you should have your email address and password (given to you by an administrator) on hand. Upon entering the website, you will be taken to the login page, as seen in \autoref{fig:initialLogin}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

 \caption{Login page}
 \label{fig:initialLogin}
\end{figure}

To login to the website, enter your email address and password. Until you do so, there is no way to access the website beyond this page. In the case that you have forgotten your email address and/or password, see \autoref{sec:contacts}: Contacts and Forgotten Passwords.

\pagebreak

\section{Home Page}
\label{sec:homepage}

Once logged in to the system, you will be presented with the home page, as seen in \autoref{fig:homePage}. From here, you can see an overview of all the initiatives you help to run. You can see the information given includes the initiative name, a brief description, and the location.

The initiative name is a link to the page of that initiative, from which you can view various metrics and details, as well as add new meetings, as detailed in \autoref{sec:initiatives}: Initiative Info and \autoref{sec:meetings}: Meetings.

As a volunteer, you should leave feedback every three months like a service user. The button to leave feedback is above the list of initiatives. For more detail see \autoref{sec:feedback}: Feedback.

Finally, at the top of the screen is the menu bar, seen in \autoref{fig:menuBar}. From here you can go between the home page and profile page (\autoref{sec:profile}), or log out.

\section{Profile Page and Detail Changes}
\label{sec:profile}

The profile page, seen in \autoref{fig:profilePage} contains all the details the Building Healthy Communities system holds on you, from name and date of birth, to emergency contacts, to the direct funding you receive. As this data is protected, only you and system administrators can view it. However, you cannot modify this information yourself, though you may send a request for an admin to change it. 

To do this, click the blue 'Change Details' button near the top right of the page. This will take you to a small text box page (\autoref{fig:detailChange}) where you may type in the details that you want to be changed, and what you want them changing to. Double check that you have typed the details correctly, as the administrator needs to know they are accurate before making the change! It is possible that an administrator may contact you before making the change anyway, but better safe than sorry.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=\textheight, keepaspectratio]{profilepage.png}}
 \caption{Profile page}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=\textheight, keepaspectratio]{detailchange.png}}
 \caption{Changing details request}
 \label{fig:detailChange}
\end{figure}

By scrolling down the details page, you can see a second section, seen in \autoref{fig:fundingInfo}. This lists all the indirect funding that the BHC programme receives related to your attendance. Indirect funding is received from various sources, either to fund a specific initiative (listed on the left), or to go towards initiatives geared towards those with particular conditions in the hope of improving their lives (listed on the right).

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=\textheight, keepaspectratio]{fundinginfo.png}}
 \caption{Indirect funding info}

\end{figure}

\section{Initiative Information}
\label{sec:initiatives}

The initiatives are the lifeblood of the BHC programme. As a volunteer, it is your job to run these initiatives, and it is from this page, seen in \autoref{fig:initiativePage} that you can view the various details necessary for this upkeep, add new sessions, and take attendance. To access the initiative page for a particular initiative, click its name on your home page.

The details visible from this page include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initiative name and area
	\item Initiative location
	\item A brief description
	\item The most recent meeting
	\item Number of enrolled members
	\item Number of funders
	\item Total meetings
	\item Average attendance
	\item Members unenrolled
	\item List of direct funding partners
	\item A graph of average attendance per meeting
\end{itemize}

 Further down the page, seen in \autoref{fig:memsandmeets}, a list of attending members along with emergency details can be seen, and further yet (also \autoref{fig:memsandmeets}) a list of all meetings, scheduled and past. Clicking the date of a meeting will take you to the page for that meeting, and clicking the 'New Session' near the top of the page will allow you to create a new session, both of which are described in detail in \autoref{sec:meetings}: Meetings.

\section{Meetings}
\label{sec:meetings}

As mentioned above, volunteers such as yourself need to not only view information, but add meetings and take attendance. To add a new session (a block of meetings), click the green 'New Session' button near the top right of the page. This will take you to a page titled 'Create a new session', seen in \autoref{fig:newSession}. The drop down menus on this page allow you to create a new block of meetings, running from the time and date specified. Each meeting will take place one week after the last, at the same time. For example, setting a date and time of 11/07/2017 15:00, and the number of weeks to run at 3, will result in meetings being scheduled at 3pm on the 11th of July, the 18th of July, and the 25th of July. 

If meetings are less frequent than weekly, they must each be scheduled separately. For example, to meet only on the 11th of July and the 25th, you would schedule a session for the 11th, running for one week, and another for the 25th, also running for one week.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=\textheight, keepaspectratio]{newsession.png}}

\end{figure}

\pagebreak

The final feature available to you as a volunteer is the ability to view the details of any given meeting for an initiative you help to run, and to take attendance for that meeting. To open a meeting page, just click its date or ID anywhere that it appears (in the meetings list, or the most recent meeting). The meeting page shows you a brief overview of the meeting, and a list of all volunteers and service users registered to attend, as seen in \autoref{fig:meetingPage}.

To take attendance, simply tick off the names of those who are in attendance, and click 'Submit' to save the list. This will now load another page (\autoref{fig:meetingAttend}) that displays the percentage of people who attended that session. It is possible to retake attendance, but please note any previous attendance data for the meeting is lost, so be sure you know who is, or was, attending before you select this option!

\section{Feedback}
\label{sec:feedback}

Leaving feedback is an important part of the BHC programme. It allows those running the programme to see the progress of everyone involved in the various initiatives, including you as a volunteer. Feedback is usually left every three months, though this time can vary, and you may leave feedback at any time. To leave feedback, click the green 'Leave Feedback' button on the home page, and you will be taken to the feedback page, seen in \autoref{fig:feedbackPage}.

The feedback form asks you a standard set of questions about how you have been feeling, and how connected you feel to your community and local area. Your answers will be compared to your previous responses in an effort to guage how much the initiatives have affected you, either in a positive or negative way. You should answer the questions honestly, and do not be afraid to say you have gotten worse. The initiatives are there to help, and if they're doing something wrong, or there's something they can do, the BHC programme administrators need to know!

\section{Contacts and Forgotten Passwords}
\label{sec:contacts}

If you want to find contact details for a given area, there is an easy way to do so. On the login page (you will have to log out if you are currently logged in), in the bottom right is the word 'Contact'. Clicking on this will bring up the contacts page, from which the addresses of the various area partnerships can be found, as seen in \autoref{fig:contactPage}. This page also includes the names and roles of people working there, and a telephone number. If you have forgotten your email address and/or password, you can call the number for your area and the team will try to help, asking you a few security questions (to make sure you're you!), before resetting your login details.
