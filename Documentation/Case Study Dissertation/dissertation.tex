Building Healthy Communities is a program which is aimed to create interventions in areas with the collaboration of the locals and generally various community groups. Its main goal is to improve the life o people by participating in various programs which will enable them to interact with other people and get a healthier approach in life. The program consist of three different types of people:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Administrators
	\item Volunteers
	\item Members
\end{itemize}
Volunteers are responsible for tracking the members progress and attendance. They also have to inform administrators not only about process of the members but also about their process. Currently all these are being performed by hand. Administrators find all the process time consuming and difficult to generally track everything. 

Our team was responsible building a software which will automate all that process. We designing and implemented a program that accepts a current database that could be modified and extended. The software has the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Register new members and delete ones that left the program
	\item Keeping track their attendance
	\item Keeping track the process not only  for the members but also for the volunteers
	\item Delete and add programs
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

Software engineering 



The following presentation presents a case study of building a database for the public health program "Building Healthy Communities". By the expression "case study" we mean the investigation of a person, group of people or a situation. The following report investigates the situation of creating a database. The team that is involved in this case study is "Team N" which consists of six, third year colleagues studying Computing Science in the University of Glasgow.

Through the following pages, we will explain in more depth, how we managed to successfully design, create and use the software that we have described above using not only our previous knowledge, but also the knowledge that we have managed to gain from the University's courses. More specifically, the "Professional Software Development and SIT" course and the "Interactive Systems 3" course played a critical role in every step that we have taken in creating the software. From the requirements gathering to the coding of the software, the lecture notes provided a step by step guide that lead to a perfect software.

As expected, the path that lead us to the creation of the program, wasn't easy. The majority of the team members had a little previous knowledge in the technologies that we have used. As a result, we had many difficulties, many will be described in the following sections.
